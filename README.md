# TIME---SERIES-FORECASTING

⏳ Time Series Forecasting Workshop: From Trends to Predictions
Master the Art of Temporal Data Modeling with Python

This notebook is your complete hands-on guide to Time Series Forecasting—a critical skill for anyone working with data that evolves over time. Whether you're analyzing stock prices, weather data, sales trends, or sensor readings, this project shows you how to model, predict, and visualize time-dependent patterns with precision.

📘 What’s Inside?
🧹 1. Time Series Data Preprocessing
Parsing dates and setting time indices

Handling missing timestamps and resampling

Decomposing time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals

📊 2. Exploratory Time Series Analysis
Time plots, rolling averages, and autocorrelation plots

Seasonal decomposition using STL and statsmodels

Stationarity testing with Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)

⚙️ 3. Feature Engineering for Time Series
Creating lag features, rolling window features, date-based features

Encoding seasonality and cyclical time components

📈 4. Forecasting Models
ARIMA/SARIMA modeling with parameter tuning

Exponential Smoothing (ETS)

Facebook Prophet for robust trend/seasonality modeling

Machine Learning Models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for time series

LSTM / RNNs (optional for advanced deep learning-based prediction)

🧪 5. Model Evaluation
Train/test split respecting time order

Evaluation metrics: MAE, RMSE, MAPE

Visual comparison of predicted vs actual values
